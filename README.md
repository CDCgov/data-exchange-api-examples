# Public Health Data Operations (PHDO) API Examples

## Overview

This repository contains example upload client scripts demonstrating use PHDO upload services. <br/>

### PHDO Upload API Environment Hostnames
| Environment   | Hostname               |
| ----          | ---------------------- |
| Development   | https://apidev.cdc.gov |
| Test          | https://apitst.cdc.gov |
| Staging       | https://apistg.cdc.gov |
| Production    | https://api.cdc.gov    |

## Setup

### Authentication via Secure Authentication Management Services (SAMS)
Users must first authenticate with SAMS before using the Upload API and retrieve an authorization token via a POST request to the **/auth** API endpoint.

The OAuth request must have the following header: 
- `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

The following query parameters must be provided:
- `username` - SAMS system account username
- `password` - SAMS system account password

Example request: `https://<hostname>/oauth?username=<your-username>&password=<your-password>`

### Provide Environment Variables via Dotenv
Once the hostname has been selected and token retrieved, those values must be set to environment variables for the example scripts to use. These can be set at the command line, or using `dotenv`. To do this, create a file in the root of this repo called `.env`. <br/>

Add the following lines to the .env file and fill out their values:
```
AUTH_TOKEN=
DEX_URL=
```

## Disclaimer
The client examples provided in this repository are meant to serve as a starting point in the development of a client and are not intended to be a final solution or a recommendation for implementation. The individual requirements of an entity implementing a client is strictly the responsibility of that entity. <br>

Examples provided include clients written in nodejs, python, java, and javascript (for use in a browser), serving as a subset of potential implementation options. Please note that the metadata fields provided in the clients are subject to change as PHDO upload services evolve and may not be kept current with PHDO code and the metadata values provided in the example clients are strictly placeholder values.
